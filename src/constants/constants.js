    title: 'Sensor-Controlled "Duck" Car — Control Theory Project',
    description: "Invovlving the development of a sensor-controlled Duck car designed to detect and maintain a calibrated distance from obstacles, the project utilized Proportional-Derivative (PD) control theory to achieve precise motion control. Using MATLAB's SISOTOOL, the calculated the controller's poles and zeros to optimize system stability and performance. The PD controller was then implemented using analog components on a breadboard, which was housed on the car's chassis. The integration of sensors allowed the car to dynamically adjust its position relative to obstacles, demonstrating the practical application of control theory in a real-world system.

    title: 'Simple Heart Rate Monitor — Analog Electronic Project',
    description: "Designed and constructed a heart rate monitor capable of detecting and measuring heartbeats within the 60-100 BPM range. The project applied theoretical knowledge from lectures to create a functional circuit using resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits. Component values were carefully calculated and extensively simulated using PSpice to ensure accuracy and optimal performance before implementing the actual circuit. This project demonstrated expertise in analog signal processing, circuit design, and simulation tools, culminating in a precise and reliable heart rate monitoring system.
